# T4M

T4M loads into World at War through DirectX `d3d9.dll` and performs enhancements to the game.
The mod works for valid versions of World at War on Steam or CD versions with a LanFixed .exe.
Modders can view the full release of T4M [here](https://www.ugx-mods.com/forum/index.php?topic=8092.0) on UGX-mods.

> CD versions of World at War SP require the [LanFixed exe](http://bit.ly/1nqdKEF)
> Steam and CD versions of World at War MP require the [LanFixed exe](https://bit.ly/3803IUC)

## Notes
- No Border: Enter this into console to enable no border -> r_fullscreen 0;vid_xpos 0;vid_ypos 0;r_noborder 1;vid_restart
- Revision 45 of the DLL
- Confirmed weapon limit to work along with every other asset limitation
- Mods created that pass the asset limits require users to have T4M
- Steam and "LanFixed" versions of the game will work with the mod not the CD version

## Bugs
- Vertex Corruption: Set all Texture/Specular/Normal Map Resolution to anything but your current settings. All THREE options SHOULD NOT BE the same as your current settings. Lower your texture settings one-by-one until it's working fine. The issue is the game is using too much VRAM than the allocated amount (1024MB capped) and I won't be able to fix it
- Steam vs CD can't connect to lobbies: Cannot fix
